# Global Warming Visualization (1880–2035)

This repository contains the code, figures, and documentation for the Week-12 climate visualization assignment.  
It includes two main visualizations:

### **1. City Warming vs. Baseline Climate (Figure 1)**  
A bubble plot comparing city-level warming since 1900 against early-century baseline temperatures.  
Bubble size reflects absolute latitude; color reflects continent.

### **2. Projected Regional & Urban Warming in 2035 (Figure 2)**  
A world map showing projected warming using historical trends and latitude-based amplification.
